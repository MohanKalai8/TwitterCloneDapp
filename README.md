## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template next-typescript-starter
```

This is the decentralized Twitter clone built on the polygon mumbai testnet using smart contracts for censorship-resistant and immutable social media interactions. With this the users can post their status, change their statuses at any time and users can see the status from the particular user at a single page.

To run this project on your local machine, run the following commands

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
